# Description: This R script should create a rough map of Qikiqtaruk - Herschel Island (QHI). It will import relevant data and create several files. A raster or vector basemap of QHI and the north slope, a higher resolution similar map of QHI, and a vector outline of just QHI, and just the north slopes, are ideal outputs of this script

# Roughly script count: #1
